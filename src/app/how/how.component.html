  <div class="pt">How it works.</div>
  <div class="info" style="max-width: none;">Compliancechimp is a Safety Compliance Management System that helps organizations achieve and maintain OSHA compliance. 
    This includes safety training, self-inspection, injury reporting, worksite logs, record-keeping, and other worker and worksite related activities. 
    Even though the cost of non-compliance is very high, most employers don't know where compliance starts or where it ends. 
    Compliancechimp takes the many disjointed requirements and puts them in one simple place where they are easily and consistently performed, 
    and reliably stored forever. An explanation of the Safety Compliance Model and our entire feature list is below.

      a virtuous cycle of continuous improvement required of every employer, which is:

    <div class="scrollsub">Train</div>
    <div class="info">Provide general and specific safety training to every 
      worker to decrease the chance of a work related injury, illness, or death.
      <br>Training is to be tracked to the individual, and 
      renewed on timely intervals to ensure top of mind safety practices.
    </div>
    <div class="scrollsub">Inspect</div>
    <div class="info">Maintain a workplace that is free from serious hazards. This is achieved through self-inspection. 
      Self-inspection helps you know what hazards exist, and whether they are under control. This must be performed for every worksite or location,
       and at a frequency that is both reasonable and defensible to keep hazards under control.
    </div>
    <div class="scrollsub">Protect</div>
    <div class="info">Provide workers with the personal protective equipment necessary to guard against injury, 
      illness, or death. Equipment should be regularly inspected, maintained, and replaced, and workers must be trained in the use of it, 
      to maintain the highest possible level of safety.
    </div>
    <div class="scrollsub">Record</div>
    <div class="info">Injuries, near misses, citations, self-inspections, and safety trainings down to the individual, 
      must be recorded to establish a record of safety and compliance in the event of an incident, audit, or inspection. Some records, such as 
      injury reports, must be maintained for decades. This data becomes crucial to improve the safety of the organization over time or serve as 
      evidence in an investigation.
    </div>
    <div class="scrollsub">Inform</div>
    <div class="info">Employers must inform workers of citations, injuries, and near-misses. This helps workers 
      understand the potential risks of the job, and affords them the opportunity to better train and prepare themselves. These events 
      create learning experiences for the entire organization, and create a clear basis for improvement and further training.
