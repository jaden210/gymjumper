    <div class="title">Worksite logs</div>
    <div class="info">Worksite logs become a daily reality with Minute. Any employee can log anything, realtime or anytime, 
      captured with text and pictures within the Minute app. Time and location are also logged. Capture the entire historical record 
      of your projects, happenings, and any incidents. Worksite logs, when combined with time, location, and training surveys, create 
      a robust record needed in the event of an accident or inspection.

    <div class="title">Team safety training</div>
    <div class="info">Training content is available 24/7, and surveys are delivered to your team’s mobile phone to ensure you 
      have a record of training received, from every employee. This enables a safer workplace and ensures leadership and teams stay 
      on the exact same page. The survey responses create the historical record of training received, which is a critical OSHA precaution.

    <div class="title">OSHA Compliance with Self-inspection</div>
    <div class="info">Minute contains OSHA’s self-inspection content and a wildly useful self-inspection wizard to tailor the OSHA
       questionnaire to your workspace. Take the assessment often and have the results stored forever. In the words of OSHA, “Self-inspection
        is essential if you are to know where probable hazards exist and whether they are under control.” We agree, and minute makes it easy.
