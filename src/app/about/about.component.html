  <div class="pt">What brought us here</div>
  <div class="info">We’re a relatively small team of engineers, web designers, and physical builders. 
    Our story is somewhat unusual. First, we built over 250 residential homes and completed many commercial 
    and government construction projects along the way. Then, we created a higher education oriented internet 
    company that served millions of students, saved them hundreds of millions of dollars, and earned a spot 
    as the fastest growing company in Utah and 17th fastest growing company in the nation on the Inc. 500, by 2012. 
    It was an extraordinary and humbling experience.  <br><br>Our path through the construction, higher education, and 
    software industries, led us to create Compliancechimp, and we are genuinely happy to be where we are. 
    Compliancechimp allows us to apply our learning to a platform we love, and continue to grow, push, 
    and develop ourselves in the process.  <br><br>We hope your team crushes it. We’ll do everything we can to 
    enable the safety compliance which protects that success.

  <div class="sub">Being 100% founder owned, and led</div>
  <div class="info">We are 100% founder owned and led. The creative force and drive that gave birth 
    to this platform are active and alive every day here. There are no hired guns. No Wall Street 
    earnings calls. Just you, us, and an expectation of product excellence and mutual success. 
    We love what we do, and intend to grow and serve our customer base for decades.

  <div class="sub">Our super simple mantra</div>
  <div class="info">One of the most prominent signs in our office says “Keep It Super Simple”. 
    Simple is hard to do, but complexity is a total drag. We push to simplify everywhere we can. 
    We say no any time we can, if yes will complicate any aspect of our product. We eliminate options. 
    We reduce paths. We opt for simplicity, clarity, and ease of use over features, every time. 
    The best software is the software that gets used and makes a difference in someone’s life. So that’s our goal. 
    And we are convinced that staying simple, approachable, and intuitive is the key to achieving it.

  <div class="sub">Our technology</div>
  <div class="info">We are entirely cloud based, running on the Google Cloud Platform. 
    We also use Google’s front end development framework (Angular) and design principles 
    (Google Material Design) to deliver the fastest and most intuitive software possible.  
    Our choice in technology ensures we can advance our platform continuously, 
    which keeps us hungry and engaged, and build something that is great and modern for users.

  <div class="sub">Hoping to make a difference</div>
  <div class="info">Statements like “OSHA Compliance” and “Safety is the responsibility of 
    every employer” aren’t inspiring. Nobody likes to be policed and threatened with existential 
    repercussions for non-compliance. But do you know what everybody does like? Coming home to their family, 
    friends, children, or maybe just Netflix every night. For all its perceived heaviness, OSHA has saved 
    hundreds of thousands of lives. And the difference between a life saved or lost, is that next safety training. 
    The difference between a business succeeding or failing, is implementation of the procedures that keep their 
    workforce safe, and compliant.
    <br><br>We hope that the work we do makes safety compliance more approachable, accessible, 
    and actionable to businesses of all sizes, in any industry.
