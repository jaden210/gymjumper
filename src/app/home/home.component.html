  <div class="quote">“All employers in the construction industry must have injury and illness prevention programs. 
    Contractors and employers who do construction work must comply with standards in 29 CFR 1926. Subpart C, General 
    Safety and Health Provisions, as well as other specific sections of these standards, include the responsibilities 
    for each contractor/employer to initiate and maintain injury and illness prevention programs, provide for a competent 
    person to conduct frequent and regular inspections, and instruct each employee to recognize and avoid unsafe conditions 
    and know what regulations are applicable to the work environment.”

    <br><br>•Provide workers with a workplace that does not have serious hazards. 
    <br><br>•Follow all OSHA safety and health standards. 
    <br><br>•Find and correct all safety and health problems. 
    <br><br>•Reduce risks first by making changes in working conditions rather than relying on personal protective equipment (PPE).

    <br><br>•Inform workers about chemical hazards through training, labels, alarms, etc. 
    <br><br>•Provide safety training to workers in a language and vocabulary they can understand. 
    <br><br>•Keep accurate records of work-related injuries and illnesses. 
    <br><br>•Perform tests in the workplace (such as air sampling), required by some OSHA standards. 
    <br><br>•Provide required PPE to employees. 
    <br><br>•Provide hearing exams or other tests required by OSHA standards. 
    <br><br>•Post OSHA citations and injury and illness data where workers can see them. 
    <br><br>•Notify OSHA within 8 hours of a workplace fatality, or 24 hours of any work-related inpatient hospitalization, amputation, or loss of an eye. 
    <br><br>•Not retaliate against workers for using their rights under this law.
