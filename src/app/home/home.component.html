    for each contractor/employer to initiate and maintain injury and illness prevention programs, provide for a competent

    <br><br>•Provide safety training to workers in a language and vocabulary they can understand. 
    <br><br>•Keep accurate records of work-related injuries and illnesses. 
    <br><br>•Perform tests in the workplace (such as air sampling), required by some OSHA standards. 
    <br><br>•Provide required PPE to employees. 
    <br><br>•Provide hearing exams or other tests required by OSHA standards. 
    <br><br>•Post OSHA citations and injury and illness data where workers can see them. 
    <br><br>•Notify OSHA within 8 hours of a workplace fatality, or 24 hours of any work-related inpatient hospitalization, amputation, or loss of an eye. 
    <br><br>•Not retaliate against workers for using their rights under this law.
