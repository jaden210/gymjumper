  <div class="header">Common Questions</div>
  <div class="question">Is there an annual contract?</div>
  <div class="answer">No. You pay month to month after your 30 day free trial. We believe you should only pay for the things you actually use and receive value from. We’ll never impose contracts on our clients.</div>
  <div class="question">How many users can join?</div>
  <div class="answer">Any number. There’s always a single account owner, who can assign as many admins as they’d like, 
    and then an unlimited number of users download the Compliancechimp app to gain access to all of the features and tools.
  </div>
  <div class="question">Can users login via desktop (web)? Or only Mobile?</div>
  <div class="answer">User features are all mobile dependent. Capturing worksite logs, accessing training, responding to 
    simple surveys, reporting or investigating an injury, and all other user features are powered by the app which is 
    available for free from the iTunes or Google Play store. Owners and admins are the only ones who access the back 
    office via the web.
  </div>
  <div class="question">Is there a limit to the amount of pictures, logs, or self-inspections?</div>
  <div class="answer">No. $99/month covers the cost of storing and retrieving pictures, worksite logs, self-inspection 
    and incident reports, plus real-time location tracking and communication...everything.
  </div>
  <div class="question">What languages is Minute offered in?</div>
  <div class="answer">English, and Spanish is becoming more complete every day. If you see translation issues, 
    or have language requests, please drop us a note at support@compliancechimp.com.
  </div>
  <div class="question">Can I cancel at any time?</div>
  <div class="answer">Of course. And we’ll even refund your current month.</div>
